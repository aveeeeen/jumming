### Mobile
![wireframe_mobile](wireframe_mobile.png)
The audience creates a graphic score using their mobile devices and sends it to the server.
Here, the music is divided into blocks of one or two bars in length, which are referred to as "block".
The block interface was inspired by Morton Feldman's "Projection 1 (1950)".

### VJ

Blocks sent by the audience are displayed in real time.
Visually indicate which notes are being played now in an easy-to-understand manner.
By using VJ to provide feedback, the audience interface can concentrate on creating the score.
